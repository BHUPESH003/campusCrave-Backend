To suggest routes for your project, I'll assume you are building a web application using a framework like Express.js for Node.js. Here are some example routes that you might want to consider for your project:

1. *User Routes:*
   - Register a new user: (done)
     - POST /api/users/register
   - Login: (done)
     - POST /api/users/login


5. *Placed Order Routes:*
   - Place a new order:
     - POST /api/placed-orders


7. *Payment Routes:*
   - Process payment:
     - POST /api/payments/process
   - Get payment details:
     - GET /api/payments/:paymentId


10. *Order Status Routes:*
    - Get all status catalog entries:
      - GET /api/status-catalog
    - Get order status for an order:
      - GET /api/order-status/:orderId
